      </p>

      <h4>1.2 Acceptance</h4>
      <p>
        By accessing or using any Obsrvr service, you agree to be bound by these
        Master Terms and any applicable Product Addenda. If you do not agree, do
        not use the services.
      </p>

        documentation and rate limits is permitted.
      </p>

      <h4>2.3 Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention</h4>

        right to pursue damages or other remedies. Appeals of termination decisions
        may be submitted to hello@withobsrvr.com within 30 days.

        services may display, analyze, and aggregate this public data.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Important Clarification:</strong> While underlying public blockchain
        data is not proprietary, Obsrvr's analysis, aggregation, presentation,
        derived metrics, and software used to process such data are proprietary to

      <p>
        <strong>Your Rights:</strong> Nothing in these terms restricts your use of
        underlying public blockchain data obtained directly from blockchain networks.
        You may not, however, replicate Obsrvr's proprietary analysis, presentation,
        or derived works without permission.
      </p>

      <h4>3.3 Open Source Components</h4>
      <p>
        Certain Obsrvr services may incorporate or interact with open-source software
        components. Such components are governed by their respective open-source
        licenses. Nothing in these Master Terms restricts your rights under applicable
        open-source licenses.
      </p>

      <h4>3.4 License Grant to You</h4>
      <p>
        Subject to your compliance with these terms, Obsrvr grants you a limited,

        services for their intended purposes.
