        <h3>How does Obsrvr Radar work?</h3>
        <p>
          Every 3 minutes we crawl the Stellar public network to gather all
          available nodes and pickup scp messages to determine if a node is
          participating in the Stellar consensus protocol.
        </p>
        <h3>How can I add my node?</h3>
        <p>
          The crawler will pick it up automatically when it is active in the
          public network and another node advertises it.
        </p>
        <h3>Why is my node not showing up?</h3>
        <p>
          A common issue is a closed port (default: 11625). Send us an

        <h3>What is organization subquorum availability?</h3>
        <p>
          Validators can add the validators of an organization to their
          quorumset. If 50% or more of the validators of an organization are
          validating correctly, this subquorum is marked as available.
        </p>
        <h3>What is a top tier organization</h3>
        <p>
          A top tier organization is part of every quorum (in a healthy network
          with quorum intersection).
        </p>
        <h3>What is the node index?</h3>
        <p>
          The node index gives nodes a basic ranking through the following
          formula:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
Index = (TypeIndex + ActiveIndex + ValidationIndex + VersionIndex + TrustIndex + AgeIndex)/6

TypeIndex = Full validator | Basic validator | Connectable node
ActiveIndex = Active percentage last 30 days
ValidationIndex = Validation percentage last 30 days
Version = How far away from the latest stable Stellar core version
Trust = How many active validators trust this node
Age = Time since discovery
                        </code></pre>
        <h3>Why does my validator reject the crawler?</h3>
        <p>
          When your validator disconnects from the crawler with an
          <a
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"

            >err_load</a
          >
          message, it is marked as 'rejected by crawler'. The crawler is
          rejected when it can successfully connect with your node, but it is
          then rejected because your node is out of sync, or your node is at
          maximum connection capacity. A possible solution is to increase
          MAX_ADDITIONAL_PEER_CONNECTIONS (inbound connections).
