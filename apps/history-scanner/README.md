# History Scanner

A standalone application for scanning and verifying Stellar history archives in
chunks. It is designed to scale by running multiple instances—each instance
communicates via REST with a central **coordinator** that schedules and stores
scan results.

## Warning

Scanning history archives can be data/network intensive. Be sure to check your
hosting provider data ingress costs before continuing.

## Overview

The **History Scanner** verifies Stellar history archives by fetching _ScanJobs_
from a coordinator service. It scans the archives in configurable _chunks_, with
concurrency determined at runtime based on performance benchmarks. After each
scan, the results are sent back to the coordinator, which persists and schedules
future scans.

**Why run separately from backend?**

- You may want to run your scanning in a different environment or cloud provider
  to minimize data ingress/egress costs.
- Running multiple standalone scanners makes it easy to scale out horizontally
  for faster verification of multiple archives or large history ranges.
- Microservice instead of 12factor app worker was chosen so you do not have to
  share (make public) your database. A REST api has a much smaller attack vector

## Architecture

1. **Coordinator** (external service):

   - Schedules scans and stores scan records/results.
   - Provides REST endpoints for workers (this app) to fetch jobs and submit
     results.

2. **History Scanner** (this app, “worker”):
   - Requests a `ScanJob` from the coordinator.
   - Scans the assigned Stellar archive range.
   - Submits a `ScanResult` to the coordinator once complete or on failure.

## Concurrency & slow archives

To avoid overloading history archives and determining an optimal scan speed, the
concurrency is calculated using some benchmarking before each scan.

A history archive that has low througput is marked as a 'slow archive'. These
archives are not fully scanned, but are limited to the latest x ledgers (See env
variables)

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone** this repository or download it.
2. **Copy** `.env.dist` to `.env`.
   - Update it with your coordinator’s API URL, credentials, etc.
3. **Install** dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
4. **Build** the scanner:

```
pnpm build
```

## Usage

Once configured, run:

```
pnpm run scan-history
```

This command starts the scanning process. It will:

- Contact the coordinator to retrieve a ScanJob.
- Download and verify Stellar history archives.
- Submit the final or incremental results back to the coordinator.
