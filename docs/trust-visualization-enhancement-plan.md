# Trust Visualization Enhancement Plan for OBSRVR Radar

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to enhance the OBSRVR Radar interface to better communicate node trust relationships and importance within the Stellar network. The goal is to help users easily distinguish between nodes that are genuinely important to network consensus versus those that may appear prominent but lack broad organizational support.

## Problem Statement

### Current Issue
The current OBSRVR Radar interface can be confusing because:
- Nodes without incoming trust lines (like sl8 validators) may appear to dominate the network
- Untrained users cannot easily identify which nodes have high levels of trust from other organizations
- This confusion may lead new validator operators to make poor quorum configuration decisions
- The interface doesn't clearly communicate node importance based on trust relationships

### Impact
- **User Experience**: Confusing interface for new users
- **Network Health**: Potential for poor quorum configuration decisions
- **Trust Understanding**: Difficulty assessing actual network influence vs. apparent prominence

## Current System Analysis

### 1. Node Display Mechanisms
**Tables & Lists:**
- `/components/node/nodes-table.vue`: Main node listing with basic info (name, organization, validator status)
- `/components/network/cards/network-nodes.vue`: Dashboard widget showing active validators with simple filtering
- Current sorting: by `index` property (descending) - appears to be a basic ranking metric

**Visual Graph:**
- `/components/visual-navigator/graph/graph.vue`: Network trust graph with D3.js visualization
- Shows nodes as circles with color coding for active/failing/selected states
- Highlights trusted/trusting relationships when nodes are selected

### 2. Trust Relationship Display
**Current Approach:**
- Trust relationships shown as edges in graph visualization
- `NodeTrustGraphBuilder.ts`: Creates directional trust graph from quorum sets
- Trust is one-way: A trusts B if B is in A's quorum set
- Colors: incoming trust (teal #73bfb8), outgoing trust (yellow #fec601)

**Trust Information Cards:**
- `node-trusted-by.vue`: Shows nodes that trust the selected node
- Simple count display with no ranking or importance weighting

### 3. Current Ranking/Scoring
**Limited Ranking Systems:**
- Node `index` property: Basic ranking metric (higher = more important)
- Network analysis focuses on blocking sets, quorum intersection, but no trust-based importance
- No existing TrustRank or PageRank-style algorithm
- No visual distinction between highly-trusted vs poorly-trusted nodes

### 4. Color Coding System
**Current Colors:**
- Blue (#1997c6): Active/validating nodes
- Red: Failing nodes  
- Yellow: Selected nodes
- Gray: Inactive nodes
- Teal (#73bfb8): Incoming trust connections
- Yellow (#fec601): Outgoing trust connections

**Missing:**
- No color coding for trust importance/centrality
- No visual indicators for "trust authority" vs "trust dependent" nodes
- No mechanism to highlight organizationally-diverse trust

## Proposed Enhancement Plan

### Phase 1: Trust Centrality Calculation Service

#### 1.1 TrustRankCalculator Service
**Implementation:**
- Create new service: `apps/backend/src/network/services/TrustRankCalculator.ts`
- Implement PageRank-style algorithm adapted for trust networks
- Calculate trust scores weighted by organizational diversity
- Account for cross-organizational trust (higher weight for diverse trust sources)

**Algorithm Components:**
- **Base Trust Score**: PageRank calculation on trust graph
- **Organizational Diversity Bonus**: Higher scores for nodes trusted by multiple organizations
- **Decay Factor**: Reduce influence of nodes with low incoming trust
- **Normalization**: Scale scores to 0-100 range for UI display

#### 1.2 Database Schema Updates
**Node Table Extensions:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE node ADD COLUMN trust_score DECIMAL(5,2) DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE node ADD COLUMN organizational_trust_diversity DECIMAL(5,2) DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE node ADD COLUMN incoming_trust_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE node ADD COLUMN outgoing_trust_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
```

#### 1.3 Interface Updates
**Node Interface Extensions:**
```typescript
interface Node {
  // ... existing properties
  trustScore: number;
  organizationalTrustDiversity: number;
  incomingTrustCount: number;
  outgoingTrustCount: number;
}
```

### Phase 2: Enhanced Visual Indicators

#### 2.1 Trust-Based Color Gradient System
**Implementation:**
- Create color gradient based on trust score
- High trust authority: Deep blue/green (#004d4d to #1997c6)
- Medium trust: Standard blue (#1997c6)
- Low/no incoming trust: Light blue/gray (#cce7f0 to #e6f3f7)
- Warning state: Orange/yellow border for nodes with concerning trust patterns

#### 2.2 Node Size Scaling
**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Scale node circle radius based on trust importance
- Base size: 8px radius
- High trust nodes: Up to 16px radius
- Low trust nodes: Down to 4px radius
- Maintain readability with minimum size constraints

#### 2.3 Trust Quality Badges
**Badge System:**
- **Gold Star**: High organizational diversity (5+ different orgs)
- **Silver Star**: Medium diversity (3-4 orgs)
- **Warning Triangle**: Low/no incoming trust
- **Diversity Ring**: Visual indicator of cross-organizational trust

### Phase 3: Improved Table Displays

#### 3.1 Enhanced Node Tables
**New Columns:**
- **Trust Score**: Numerical score (0-100) with sorting
- **Trusted By**: Count with organizational breakdown tooltip
- **Trust Quality**: Badge/icon indicating trust diversity
- **Organizational Reach**: Number of different organizations that trust this node

#### 3.2 Default Sorting and Filtering
**Improved Defaults:**
- Default sort by trust importance instead of index
- Secondary sort by organizational diversity
- Tertiary sort by uptime/reliability

#### 3.3 Trust Warnings and Indicators
**Visual Indicators:**
- **Red Warning**: Nodes with zero incoming trust
- **Yellow Caution**: Nodes with low organizational diversity
- **Green Check**: Well-trusted nodes with good diversity
- **Info Icon**: Hover tooltips explaining trust metrics

### Phase 4: Advanced Filtering & Analysis

#### 4.1 Trust-Based Filters
**Filter Options:**
- "Show only well-trusted nodes" toggle
- Minimum trust score slider
- Organizational diversity filter
- Trust relationship type filters

#### 4.2 Trust Analysis Dashboard
**New Dashboard Components:**
- **Trust Centralization Metrics**: Gini coefficient for trust distribution
- **Organization-Level Trust Analysis**: Inter-organizational trust matrix
- **Trust Concentration Warnings**: Alerts for concerning trust patterns
- **Historical Trust Trends**: Trust score changes over time

#### 4.3 Advanced Visualizations
**New Visualization Features:**
- **Trust Heatmap**: Grid showing trust relationships between organizations
- **Trust Flow Diagram**: Sankey-style diagram showing trust flow
- **Trust Clustering**: Group nodes by trust communities
- **Trust Path Analysis**: Show trust paths between nodes
